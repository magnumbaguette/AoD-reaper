# To do:

- Make a canvas wrapping around the aod base section.(this can be left as is; the already
  working page is black in background-color and would serve no purpose to do it all again)
	* this is for adding the latest info from the alliane.
- Add authorisation functionality.
	* this auth functionality requires RESTFUL api service and this requires me to 
	  understand the concept of node.js properly and then learn express.js for setting
	  up the webserver and then provide the api for use.
